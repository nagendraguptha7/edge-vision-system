Edge AI Vision System for Industrial Monitoring

This project is a prototype implementation and system design of a real-time multi-camera intelligent vision system built for industrial environments.

The main goal of the system is to use edge-based computer vision to improve safety, monitor activities, and support operational efficiency on the factory floor.

Features included in this project:

*Real-time object detection

*Basic video analytics and alert generation

*Edge-style processing pipeline simulation

*Architecture designed to match real production systems
